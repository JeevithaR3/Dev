#     #host="0.0.0.0": This is a crucial DevOps detail. By default, Flask only listens on 127.0.0.1 (your local machine). Setting it to 0.0.0.0 tells the app to listen on all available network interfaces. This is 
#     # usually required to access the app from inside a Docker container or over a network.\
#     #port=5000: This sets the specific "door" the app listens on.
